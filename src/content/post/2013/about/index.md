Since Gradualizing B.Sc in 1999, I have had the pleasure of creating digitization solutions with exciting companies such as Ørsted, Microsoft, GN and public institutions.

Recent 11 years as an independent, self-employed consultant with focus on enterprise- and solution architecture and advising on cloud-based collaboration solutions like Office 365.

Often, I participate in communication with the business on analysis and documentation of processes and agile requirements specification, and typically have a leading role in translating these into solid design decisions in a final solution. 

I am a big fan of agile processes like scrum and devops, and prefer lightweight architecture with a focus on creating business value. Incidentally, I belong to the group of IT architects who can roll up their sleeves, and program complex logic. Although this is rarely my primary task, I believe that it is an important competence in order to understand the consequences of design decisions that may unintentionally be putting brakes on developers.
