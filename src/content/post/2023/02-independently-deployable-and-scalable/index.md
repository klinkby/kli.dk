# Quality attributes for microservices - part 2

> This is the second post in [the series](../quality-attributes-for-microservices/) about some ideal characteristics
about microservices, both from the architect's perspective as well as developer's and operations perspective. In this
post we will have a look on deployment and scalability of microservices.

_In my humble opinion a good microservice..._
# "Is independently deployable and scalable"

## Scaling up or out

For systems that may experience growing load, or demands high availability, it is important to be able to scale the system.

More load can be managed by either vertical (up) or horizontal (out) scaling. Vertical scaling is achieved by adding
more resources to the existing system, like purchasing beefier servers with more memory or CPU cores. Raising
availability by vertical scaling means expensive redundant server components like dual power supplies, network cards and
RAID hard drives. While hardware is getting faster and cheaper, this approach will only get you so far, and eventually
the system will reach a limit where it is not feasible to add more resources.

While scale up is usually the only option for monolithic systems, microservices can enjoy the benefits of horizontal
scaling, where more cheap commodity servers are added to the system behind a network load balancer to provide almost
linear scale in performance and availability

## Independently deployable

To be able to scale out microservices must be independently deployable. This means that each service node can be
deployed without affecting other services and join the load balancer pool when ready to take requests. This enables
dynamic scaling, where additional nodes are added dynamically at peak load times and stopped again when load decreases.
In the cloud service that only charge for running time this is a cost effective solution for handling dynamic load,
as opposed to paying for a group of idle servers, just waiting for that peak day of the month.  

## Deterministic and stateless

The load balancer can choose to send an incoming request to any service node. The processing of the request should
ideally come up with the same result no matter what joined service that processed it. To achieve this the services
must behave deterministic and stateless.

Stateless means that no state is shared between requests within the service, and can only be stored in the persistent
backend database shared between the nodes. Therefore special care must be taken with static singletons for things like
incremental counters, in-service caching where one request will influence the next.

Processing that takes input from random number generators or server-generated timestamps makes requests
non-deterministic. The fact that a server's real time clock drift means each node will produce different responses to
the same request, and these inputs should ideally avoided or generated by the shared backend database.

## Conclusion

So to wrap up, microservices should be independently deployable and scalable. This means that each service node can
be deployed without affecting other services and join a load balancer pool when ready to take requests. This enables
dynamic scaling, where additional nodes are added dynamically at peak load times, and stopped again when load decreases.

In the next post we will have a look on how microservices can be deployed.
Thank you for reading and have a wonderful day!
