# Contribute to a cure for novel corona virus

So you are following the current government guidelines of keeping your distance to minimize the risk of spreading the novel corona virus. Is there more you can do that staying at home?

Virologists and molecular biologists everywhere are currently busier than ever, searching for a way to inhibit the pathogen from spreading by studying its building blocks. Back in February the University of Washington Institute of Protein Design accurately predicted the atomic scale structure of the coronavirus and revealed the virus' spike protein (it uses for piercing a human cell membrane).

The institute runs complex computations on a *distributed* computer with an estimated power of whopping 1792 teraflops
