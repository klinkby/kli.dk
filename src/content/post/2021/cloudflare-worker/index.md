# Adding a CloudFlare Worker

> 2026-02-28 update: This site is now hosted from Hetzner.

This static website is generated by [Hugo](../../2020/hugo) to Azure Storage blob-based static website and served from
CloudFlare CDN. Out of the box it's pretty good. CloudFlare's encryption is
graded [A+ on SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=kli.dk&latest).

In the CloudFlare dashboard I added Page Rules to redirect naked root domain requests to `www` and enable CloudFlare's
minifier + cache. To add strict security HTTP headers and proper `404 Not Found` responses, I had to turn
to [CloudFlare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), i.e. simple NodeJS script that runs in the CloudFlare pipeline
between edge cache and origin server.

Heavily inspired by [Scott Helme](https://scotthelme.co.uk/security-headers-cloudflare-worker/) I wrote
this https://gist.github.com/klinkby/8e161a3e2926ecc7d7b53a5c57bf0790 , which provide
an [A grade](https://securityheaders.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kli.dk%2F) in Scott's security headers analyzer.
