title: iTunes compression disappointment
---


I heard this great band on Norwegian television called [ Metropolitan](http://www.curlinglegs.musiconline.no/shop/displayArtist.asp?cid=2&cname=Jazz&sid=&name=&id=23681&aname=METROPOLITAN), a jazz big band including a string section that plays nice lounge jazz. So I bought the album from Apple's iTunes online store. It set me back DKK 80,- (about half the price of a CD), and the iTunes application started downloading it immediately. A bit pricy, but ok. After a couple of minutes it was finished, and I browsed to the download folder and was shocked to see the entire album was just about 50MB! Even though it uses [AAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding), the lossy [compression artifacts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_artifact) are absolutely audiable at that bitrate. It may be good enough for Britney Spears or Bon Jovi - but it sure isn't good enough for Metropolis or classical music. I always rip CDs to lossless compression - so I can later transcode to another lossless format or compress for a portable device without any double-destructive-compression artifacts. Needless to say, I will never use iTunes again.
