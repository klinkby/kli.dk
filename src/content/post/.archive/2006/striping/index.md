I have had a 250GB Maxtor hard disk ([ 6V250F0](http://www.maxtor.com/_files/maxtor/en_us/documentation/data_sheets/diamondmax_10_data_sheet.pdf)) in my setup for some time, and been very happy with it. It's [very quiet](http://www.silentpcreview.com/article244-page3.html), has 16 MB cache, [SATA2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SATA2#SATA_3.0_Gb.2Fs) and [NCQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Command_Queuing). Recently I added another one of these disks to my box. I have an Asus A8N-SLI Premium motherboard, that have a nForce4 and a Silicon Image 3114 based RAID controller installed. The [ nVRAID is faster than the SI](http://www.planetamd64.com/index.php?showtopic=21897&st=40#) controller, so decided to go with nVidia's. I started out with only the new hard drive cabled, and changed the bios to enable RAID on the controller. In RAID bios I then added the drive as a stripe (yes that's striping on one drive). I have an XP installation CD with my motherboard drivers prepared with [nLite](http://www.nliteos.com/), so Windows setup immediately recognised the RAID controller and installed Windows onto that. [ ![](http://static.getya.net/013/images/windowslivewriterstriping-d264striping-thumb1.jpg)](http://static.getya.net/013/images/windowslivewriterstriping-d264striping21.jpg)In Windows I copied data from my old harddisk to the new one. Went back to the bios and added my old drive to the raid drive pool. In nVidia's MediaShield application I could then add the drive to the stripe, and immediately started rebuilding the RAID. Pretty easy setup, and it's blazing fast. Update: See [http://klinkby.wordpress.com/2007/06/18/nvraid-errors/](http://klinkby.wordpress.com/2007/06/18/nvraid-errors/)
