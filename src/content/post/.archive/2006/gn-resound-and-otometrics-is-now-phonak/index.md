title: GN Resound and Otometrics is now Phonak
---


Swiss hearing aid giant Phonak recently purchased the company for which I work for some 15.5 billion dkk. I think it is likely that Phonak will restructure Resound to gain from synergies in what is now the world's largest hearing aid company. Resound is 10% behind the EBITA earned by Phonak.
