No, I'm not talking career change here - no flashlights please. I just fell over this video from the [Microsoft Oslo](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd129873.aspx "Microsoft Oslo") team that presents modeling through the ages in a cartoon and a brief introduction to Oslo and Quadrant. [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCygFQ8MI5c&hl=en&fs=1] For more on 10x productivity see the [A lap around Oslo](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL23/) session from the PDC.
