The past 1Â½ years I've had to reinstall my Vista 4 (four) times. Yes, it's a developer workstation - but I exclusively do managed code and doesn't fiddle around with custom kernel drivers and such. So obviously I'm not too big a fan of the stability of the Windows Vista operating system.

After a Vista installation I usually spend hours disabling unneeded services, uninstalling bloat and disabling annoying TSR-like programs just to keep Vista from running like a slug in a molasses bath. Actually Windows Defender just started a scan this minute - just to annoy me. :-)

After reading some articles ([here](http://www.win2008workstation.com/wordpress/), [ here](http://blogs.msdn.com/vijaysk/archive/2008/02/11/using-windows-server-2008-as-a-super-desktop-os.aspx), [ here](http://exo-blog.blogspot.com/2008/03/windows-2008-vista-done-right.html) and [ here](http://wastingtimewithmikeandari.wordpress.com/2008/02/09/windows-server-2008-10-faster-and-uses-23-the-ram-of-vista/)) about using the latest and greatest Windows Server 2008 as a workstation OS, I decided to give it a try, and I must say it absolutely rocks.

The benchmarks in the articles are right, this is the fastest Windows to date.
