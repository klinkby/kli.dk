My websites has been down for a week after my web host's server crashed. So I moved my sites to a faster and more [reliable host](http://www.unoeuro.com/) - and it's even a lot cheaper. In the process updated my [fonts.dk](http://fonts.dk/) site to a more updated design and augmented the site with some of my recent code units plus some advanced caching. Please tell me what you think.
