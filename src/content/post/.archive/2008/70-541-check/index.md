This morning I passed the Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 - Application Development exam with 809 out of 1000
points with a passing score of 700. The 55 questions mostly concerned the SP API, feature deployment and security. I was
a bit surprised to see two questions regarding records management that I would have thought was part of the MOSS exam.
And also a question where the correct answer was using members that is marked obsolete:
the [ RegisterHiddenField](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.page.registerhiddenfield(VS.80).aspx)
method and
the [ RequestFromAdminPort](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.page.registerhiddenfield(VS.80).aspx)
property.
