title: IE8 will default to high standards mode
---


Recently Microsoft revised their [position](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/15/467901.aspx) and [ announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/03/microsoft-s-interoperability-principles-and-ie8.aspx) that the next Internet Explorer will not run in the "Quirks"-mode by default, but will actually render sites according to standards. Great... and finally.
