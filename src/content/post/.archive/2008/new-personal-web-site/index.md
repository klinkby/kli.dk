Today I published my new personal web site at [http://kli.dk/](http://kli.dk/). Generally speaking it uses lots of external services - very web2-3.0'ish - to compose the content on the site. The site:   

*   Was built in a weekend with Visual Web Developer 2008 Express, i.e. ASP.NET/C#
*   Validates to XHTML1.1, CSS2.1 and Web2.0. :)
*   Content is provided by Wordpress, YouTube, flickr and del.icio.us
*   Responses are compressed and cached for fast loading
*   Navigation and meta data is provided by web.sitemap
*   Google sitemap.xml is generated from web.sitemap
*   Eliminates the www and Default.aspxs
*   Theme is scalable, centered and variable-width
*   Statistics is tracked by Google Analytics  Take a look and suggest ways to improve it.
