title: Cool’n’Quiet on A8N32/Vista
---


Since I installed Windows Vista, I've been looking for at way to get my Asus A8N32 motherboard to support Cool'n'Quiet. No drivers or bios upgrades were available on the slow Asus website. I bumped into [ a post](http://vip.asus.com/forum/view.aspx?id=20070228001432266&board_id=1&model=A8N32-SLI+Deluxe&page=1&SLanguage=en-us) telling about an unofficial 1403 bios, that supposedly supports CnQ under Vista 32/64. I took the chance and installed the bios and it seems to work fine. The bios (crc32: 9796387A) can be downloaded from [here](http://www.davidschofield.co.uk/asus1403.rom) or [here](http://hellscreem.org/A8N32-SLI%20DELUXE%20asus1403.zip). Update: Asus released a [ 1405 beta](http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/socket939/A8N32-SLI%20Deluxe/1405.zip).
