Well today I passed the Microsoft test 70-630 that certifies me as 'Technology Specialist in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, Configuring'. That's a definite double-whoa! :-) Compared to the 70-631 it has less peripherical stuff but concentrates more on the server, its site templates, upgrading and handing out the right credentials to users. 70-541/542, look out...
