This week I attended the three day [Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 conference](https://live.sharepoint-conference.eu/) in Berlin. The conference was aimed at developers, IT pros and business decision makers, so it was a variegated crowd. SharePoint is the fastest growing server product ever so it's no surprise the conference was completely sold out.

I mostly watched the developer sessions, that turned out to give a good overview of the SharePoint possibilities and new features - but lacked some technical depth.

There were a mix of european evangelists (mostly German) and American, of whom [Mike Fitzmaurice](http://blogs.msdn.com/mikefitz/) was the most remarkable and interresting presenter.

The Excel Services was very impressive and the BDC definately is a powerful feature for integration. I hope Microsoft will release some developer support tools, and finish the documentation soon to improve developer productivity and take the guesswork out of SharePoint development.
