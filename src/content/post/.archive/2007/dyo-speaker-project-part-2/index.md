Here is the theoretical normalized frequency response from the box. The 3dB points are 57Hz and 505Hz. The spike at 2kHz
is a vent resonance peak. The BassBox program takes many parameters into consideration and helps a lot to get the exact
chamber volumes and vent tunings. ![box-response](http://static.getya.net/013/images/box-response.gif) The next pair of
screenshots are from [Google Sketch-up](http://sketchup.google.com/). You can click to enlarge. There is no way I could
have crammed the devices in there without this
model. [![3d-1](http://static.getya.net/013/images/3d-1-thumb.jpg)](http://static.getya.net/013/images/3d-1.jpg)[![3d-2](http://static.getya.net/013/images/3d-2-thumb.jpg)](http://static.getya.net/013/images/3d-2.jpg)
This is a shot of the wired crossover. The box is ready to be
closed. ![Speaker 040](http://static.getya.net/013/images/speaker-040.jpg)
