Here is the theoretical normalized frequency response from the box. The 3dB points are 57Hz and 505Hz. The spike at 2kHz is a vent resonance peak. The BassBox program takes many parameters into consideration and helps a lot to get the exact chamber volumes and vent tunings. ![box-response](http://static.getya.net/013/images/box-response.gif) The next pair of screenshots are from [Google Sketch-up](http://sketchup.google.com/). You can click to enlarge. There is no way I could have crammed the devices in there without this model.

The box is ready to be closed. ![Speaker 040](http://static.getya.net/013/images/speaker-040.jpg)
