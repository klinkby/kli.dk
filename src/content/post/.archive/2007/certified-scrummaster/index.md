These last two days I've been taught the principles of [Scrum](http://www.scrumalliance.org/view/what_is_scrum) in agile development and become a certified ScrumMaster. The instructors [Jens Østergård](http://www.scrum.dk) and the world famous [Jeff Sutherland](http://www.jeffsutherland.com/scrum/) both brought an enormous amount of experience and inspiration to the fully booked class of about 30 people. Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber where the inventors of Scrum.

The course was held at Nordija in Lyngby where the famous writer and OO guru [James O. Coplien](http://users.rcn.com/jcoplien/) happens to work. We were lucky to get him to give a lecture on lightweight architecturing (which I am very much interested in).

All in all, two mind bogglingly inspiring and well spent days. I would recommend it to anyone just remotely interested in agile software development.

- Waterfall model? Never again!
