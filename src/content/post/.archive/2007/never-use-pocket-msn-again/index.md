title: Never use Pocket MSN again!
---

  I got the HTC P4350 pda smartphone. Its Windows Mobile 5 has a mobile version of MSN Messenger called [ Pocket MSN](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/microsoftprograms/pocketmsn.mspx). I just had the most alarming experience chatting with a friend, where Pocket MSN displayed the wrong display name: While Pocket MSN said I was talking to 'A', I was actually talking to 'B'!!! Needless to say it was a very weird conversation, and it's the last time I ever use Pocket MSN. [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) anyone?
