The paint job is now complete and the speaker boxes are complete. Well I still need to put a framed cloth on the front,
but that's a minor task and will come in time. The important thing is the speakers are now playing in the living room.

Notice the dvd and the cd to the right. I expect to build a piece of furniture between the speakers to hold a row of
DVDs and a drawer with to rows of cds.
