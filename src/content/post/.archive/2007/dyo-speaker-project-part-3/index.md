I have been quite busy lately. Slowly but surely the speakers have now been assembled and tested
with [various sounds](http://www.dogstar.dantimax.dk/testwavs/), and they are behaving as expected. The picure shows the

paint. Then I repeat sanding and layers of high gloss white paint until the surface is all nice and uniform. As a finish
