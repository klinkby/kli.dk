[![Speaker paint 001](http://static.getya.net/013/images/speaker-paint-001-thumb.jpg)](http://static.getya.net/013/images/speaker-paint-001.jpg)I have been quite busy lately. Slowly but surely the speakers have now been assembled and tested with [various sounds](http://www.dogstar.dantimax.dk/testwavs/), and they are behaving as expected. The picure shows the current status. First I used a sander with corn 60 to straighten out the joints. Then corn 120 and a layer of base paint. Then I repeat sanding and layers of high gloss white paint until the surface is all nice and uniform. As a finish I expect to apply two layers of laquer. I'm glad I didn't start a project like this: [http://www.royaldevice.com/custom.htm](http://www.royaldevice.com/custom.htm "http://www.royaldevice.com/custom.htm") (scroll down to the horn subwoofer!).
