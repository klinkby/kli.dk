[ ![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/517/39/320/vista_on_xp.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/517/39/1600/vista_on_xp.jpg)I really didn't have the nerves to provide my home PC with a release candidate of Vista, so I decided to give the new Microsoft Virtual Server 2005 a spin and install Windows Vista on this. There's definately a performance overhead (note to self: buy more RAM), but it seems to works like a charm.
