The last 4½ years I have designed and developed Windows client software for [audiological medical devices](http://www.gnotometrics.dk/). It has been very interesting and challenging though it's a somewhat conservative business segment. Starting January 2007 I will again be in the consulting business, as I am joining the Microsoft solution provider [Progressive IT](http://www.progressive.dk/) that offered me a position as software development consultant. The company develops high quality information, integration and project management solutions. I am looking very much forward to this change in pace and think it will offer a lot of new experiences.
