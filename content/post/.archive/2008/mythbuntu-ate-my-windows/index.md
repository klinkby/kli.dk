title: Mythbuntu ate my Windows
---


Using my notebook I installed [Mythbuntu 8.10](http://www.mythbuntu.org/) on an external USB harddisk, as I wanted to see how MythTV compares to WMC on my HTPC. For some reason (only known to Mythbuntu developers) the installer also also decided to write a [GRUB](http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) boot loader on the internal harddrive, on which I had [ HP Drive Encryption](http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareDescription.jsp?lang=en&cc=sg&prodTypeId=321957&prodSeriesId=3355650&prodNameId=3355661&swEnvOID=2103&swLang=8&mode=2&taskId=135&swItem=ob-48966-1) enabled.Â  Goodbye Windows. R.I.P.
