title: Geocaching on Codeplex
---


Even in the era of semantic web and openness, Geocaching.com does not provide a web service for querying the community created cache locations. But the peakhole that enables Google Earth to display geocaches, could be used by other applications. So I created a small example on [codeplex.com](http://www.codeplex.com/gc) that demonstrates how to query for caches from a C# application.
