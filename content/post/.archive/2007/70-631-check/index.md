Today I passed the Microsoft test 70-631 that certifies me as 'Technology Specialist in Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, Configuring', whoa! It is clealy a new test, e.g. I was presented with the exact same question twice, and some of the questions were more about guessing the questioner's thoughts than about exact knowledge about SharePoint knowledge. The questions range from network security, over ISA, SQL and MOM right down to views in the WSS recycle bin. As preparation I have worked with SharePoint for 8 months and read sections of the [ Office SharePoint Server 2007 Administrator's Compation](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-Office-Sharepoint-Administrators-Companion/dp/0735622825/ref=sr_1_2/026-0205249-8333232?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187690411&sr=8-2). So in abbreviations I'm now MCP, MCDBA, MCSD and MCTS ;-)
