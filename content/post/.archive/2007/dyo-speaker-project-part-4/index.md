[![Speaker complete 001](http://static.getya.net/013/images/speaker-complete-001-thumb.jpg)](http://static.getya.net/013/images/speaker-complete-001.jpg)The paint job is now complete and the speaker boxes are complete. Well I still need to putÂ a framed cloth on the front, but that's a minor task and will come in time. The important thing is the speakers are now playing in the living room.

Notice the dvd and the cd to the right. I expect to build a piece of furniture between the speakers to hold a row of DVDs and a drawer with to rows of cds.
